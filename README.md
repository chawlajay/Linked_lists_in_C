# Linked_lists_in_C
Made a header file to use linked lists functions.
Header file contains some functions like insertion ,deletion,display etc which are easy to understand and implement.
Uploaded one C file also to understand its working.
2 Header files are there. linked_lists.h is for normal linked list and CLL.h is for Circular Linked lists(CLL).
Similarly main.c is for normal LL and main_CLL.c is for CLL

# Header-of-String-functions

made some functions that can be used for string manipulation.
For example : 1. to get string length
              2. to replace some substring
              3. to find a position of a character or substring, etc
              
I have made it using Dynamic memory Allocation - malloc().
I hope it will be helpful for those who want to understand the dynamic memory allocation.
